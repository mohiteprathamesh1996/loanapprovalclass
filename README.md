# Loan Approval Prediction Pipeline

Welcome to the Loan Approval Prediction Pipeline repository. This project showcases an automated end-to-end pipeline for predicting loan approval status, facilitating streamlined deployment and collaboration.

## Overview

This project encompasses the entire data science workflow, from data preprocessing to model creation and deployment. We've integrated best practices for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure scalability, reproducibility, and agility in our deployment process.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** We have implemented comprehensive data preprocessing techniques to clean and transform raw loan data, optimizing it for predictive modeling.

- **Model Creation:** We've developed and fine-tuned machine learning models in Python to accurately predict loan approval status based on the preprocessed data.

- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline:** To simplify and accelerate the deployment process, we've established a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. This pipeline automates the testing, model deployment, and API setup.

- **Docker Containerization:** Docker containers are used to encapsulate the model, ensuring consistency and portability. This minimizes deployment conflicts and dependencies.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** We've incorporated IaC principles to manage the deployment infrastructure. This approach enables scalable and reproducible model deployments.

- **YAML Configuration:** The CI/CD pipeline configurations are managed using YAML files, enhancing flexibility and ease of maintenance.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the necessary Python environment and install the required dependencies.
3. Run the data preprocessing scripts to prepare your data.
4. Train and evaluate the loan approval prediction model using the provided Jupyter notebooks.
5. Configure the CI/CD pipeline by updating the YAML files to match your deployment requirements.
6. Use Docker to package your model for deployment.
7. Utilize the provided API to integrate the model predictions into your applications.
